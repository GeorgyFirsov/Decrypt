# Decrypt

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: it is just an experiment to improve my skills in machine learning and data science. It is not an accurate method for decryption. I 
just want to find out various regularities in words encrypted with different methods and research them.

### Motivation

It is hard to decrypt a message with unknown encryption method. Main reason for this fact is following: encryption methods are developed in such a way to make you not to find out original message easily without a knowledge about encryption method used for this concrete text.

I think it is possible to make some dictionary with all the words encrypted with some method (for instance, with Caesar cipher). But having such dictionaries for almost all encryption methods means having A LOT OF SPACE on your HDD. In our time, I think, it is impossible to have such amount of disk storage.

So... This project is my attempt to avoid problems mentioned above and apply machine learning to solve this task.
